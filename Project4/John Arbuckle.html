    <h1>About John Arbuckle</h1>

    <p>Hi there everyone! My name is <u>John Arbuckle</u>. I am 30 years old and I am a cartoonist that lives in Muncie, Indiana. I am a proud owner of a cat named <strong>Garfield</strong> and a dog named <strong>Odie</strong>. Garfield is fat, lazy, and he loves to eat, while Odie is a dog without a brain. Although my pets drive me <em>crazy</em>, I can't imagine life without them.</p>

    <p>I spend about half my time going to the grocery store to buy enough food to feed Garfield. I have to make sure to buy all of Garfield's favorite foods, otherwise he gets grumpy. This includes milk, cheese, bread, ham, chicken wings, potato chips, pasta with marinara sauce, frozen pizzas, and <strong>lots and lots</strong> of lasagna. When I come home, Garfield usually attacks me and tries to everything in the grocery bag before I even have time to put it in the refridgerator. One time he ate everything I bought in 30 seconds, and I had to go back to the store to buy more food. <em>I wasn't too happy about that.</em></p>
